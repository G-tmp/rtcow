# A webrtc demo on RTCPeerConnection api, communication between two devices in LAN



## dev

* peers exchange SDP(offer, answer) and ICE candidates via signaling server, ICE server is unneeded in LAN

* ```mediaDevices.getUserMedia``` must using HTTPS or the file:/// URL scheme, or a page loaded from localhost

*  HTTPS connect to insecure ws will be blocked by many browsers due to security problems, if using HTTPS then must using wss

*  self-signed SSL CA certificates by [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

* ```sigs``` is a signaling server writen by golang gorilla websocket

* websocket server serve a / route for SSL warning, wss connection from 192.168.101.* will be blocked, accept untrusted certificate before connect to wss

* RTCDataChannel relies on ```SCTP``` transport layer, reliable and ordered data transfer like TCP and message-based data like UDP

* firefox ```about:webrtc```
